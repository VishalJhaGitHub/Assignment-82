    "#A contingency matrix, also known as a confusion matrix, is a table that visualizes the performance of a classification model by comparing its predicted labels with the true labels of a dataset. It is used to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of a classification model in terms of various metrics such as true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. The matrix is typically organized into rows and columns, where each row represents the instances in a predicted class, and each column represents the instances in an actual class."

    "#A pair confusion matrix, also called an error analysis matrix, is a variation of a regular confusion matrix that focuses on pairs of classes rather than individual classes. It provides a more detailed analysis of the model's performance by showing the specific combinations of classes that are often misclassified. This matrix can be useful in situations where distinguishing between certain pairs of classes is particularly important or challenging. It helps identify specific patterns of misclassifications and can guide the improvement of the model's performance for specific class pairs."
